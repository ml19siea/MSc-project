this is a code for social distacing violations using yolov3. This yolov3 model is trained using the given dataset.

images for testing purpose are present in testing folder. let us predict the result by running main.py file.

1. provide paths for yolov3_custom_final.weights, yolov3_test.cfg,classes.names and testing image.jpg inside main.py file.

2. threshold value for distance is 170.

3. run main.py file.this generates result as output.jpg file.
