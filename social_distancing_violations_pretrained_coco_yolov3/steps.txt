this is a code for social distacing violations using yolov3. this model is pretrained on coco dataset.

we are going to run this model on video and image. refer image.py and video.py files for running the code.data for testing is present in testing folder.

1. provide paths for coco.names,yolov3.weights, yolov3.cfg and testing image.jpg or video clip vid.mp4 inside the image.py/video.py file.
2. threshold value is taken 170 for image.py as well as video.py. this value may change based on image size. 
currently it is 170 and it works fine for images present in testing folder. 
3. run image.py/video.py file for images/video using below command and it saves result as an output.jpg/output.mp4 file.


for input image run below code
python image.py
 

for input video run below code
python video.py --output output.mp4
