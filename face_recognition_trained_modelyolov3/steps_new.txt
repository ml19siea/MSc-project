this is the object detection task where we are detecting person's identity and marking their faces.
we have trained yolov3 model on our dataset and resultant .weights and .cfg files are taken for prediction purpose.

follow below steps for running the code. we are using input image/video for prediction. test.py file is for images and video.py file is for video input.

1. open test.py/video.py  file and provide path for .cfg, .weights, classes.names and test imagg.jpg/video.mp4 file. 
2. Threshold values are chosen as conf_thresh=0.8 and nms_thresh=0.5.
3. Run the code

image
python test.py

video
python video.py --output output.mp4

result is saved as output.jpg/output.mp4 file every time we run the code.
