this is the object detection task where we are detecting person's identity and marking their faces.
we have trained yolov3 model on our dataset and resultant .weights and .cfg files are taken for prediction purpose.

follow below steps for running the code.

1. open test.py  file and provide path for .cfg, .weights, classes.names and test image .jpg file. 
2. Threshold values are chosen as conf_thresh=0.8 and nms_thresh=0.5.
3. Run test.py file  >>>>> python test.py

result is saved as output.jpg file every time we run test.py file.
