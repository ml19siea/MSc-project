we are using pretrained facenet model and trained SVC classifier. 

training SVC and testing

training images are present in train_img folder and testing images are present in testing folder.


1.  training images are present in train_img folder and they are aligned by running following code. this creates aligned images inside aligned_img folder. 
provide path for train_img folder and aligned_img folder inside data_preprocess.py file. 

python ./data_preprocess.py

2. once our dataset (aligned_img) is ready, we will go for training svc model.open train_main.py file and provide aligend images, model, classifier path.
use classifier_test.py file for training of svc. run below code to start the training. this training generates classifier.pkl file inside class folder.
this result gives all metrics values and confusion matrix plot.

python ./train_main.py


3. predict the result by running below code on input image from testing folder. the resultant image is saved as output.jpg file

python ./main.py --output output.jpg
